                <p>
                    Microorganisms are useful in producing foods, treating waste water, creating biofuels, and a wide range of chemicals and enzymes.They are invaluable in reasearch as model organisms.<img class="floatR" src="../images/summary.jpeg" alt="Human with microorganisms"/>
             		They  are vital to agriculture through their roles in maintaining soil fertility and decomposing organic matter.

                <p>
                    Unfortunately, These organisms can be quite dangerous and even cause death, an example of such are toadstools.Some of these organisms cause diseases such as amoeba and the HIV virus.
                    Through research done on these microorganisms, there have been cases where the research is meant for and has produced bioweapons which are being used for terrorism and bioterrorism.
                    The Most recent example is the speculation that the Corona virus was weaponized and released from  a lab in Wuhan, China..
                </p>
                <p>
                    Despite these shortcomings doing away with these microorganisms is not an option since our survival depends on these microorgansim.Therefore we have to learn to live wih them.Moreover exploit them and learn be able to gain from such an endeavour.
