        <h2>Viruses</h2>
        <section><h3>Introdunction</h3>
            <p>Viruses are the smallest microorganisms found so far that can only live in living organisms.
                Although they are so tiny, once they enter the host's cells, they will cause great damage.<br />
                No matter animals or plants can't escape the virus attack, for example, common cold, herpes and
                hepatitis are diseases caused by viruses. In the past two decades, the most serious disease, AIDS,
                was caused by a virus called "HIV".
                <br>
                And Currently the Corona Virus, now declared a pandemic, is plagueing the world.

            <h2>Virus Classification</h2>
            <p>Viruses are not only divided into plant viruses, animal viruses and bacterial viruses. From the
                structure, it is also divided into: single-stranded RNA virus, double-stranded RNA virus, single-stranded
                DNA virus and double-stranded DNA virus
            </p>

            <h2>Virus Invading</h2>
            <p>The virus invading the body may be caused by a sneeze or a physical contact. Viruses need to be parasitic
                within living host cells, and rely on the host cells to provide the raw material system, energy, and location
                required for virus replication. When a virus is ready to infect a host cell, it needs the following six steps
                to complete its proliferation activities, namely adsorption, invasion, shelling, biosynthesis, assembly, and
                release.

            <h2>Future trends</h2>
            <p>Although they are very harmful to organisms, because they can insert genetic material into the host,
                viruses are now widely used for genetic engineering experiments.<br /> With the continuous development
                of science and technology, microbiology has gradually become a major subject in biological research.
                It is foreseeable that it is very important for the improvement of human well-being in the 21st century.
