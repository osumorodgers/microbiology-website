            <p><img class="floatL m-r-s" src="../images/body.jpeg" width="280" height="320" alt="man made of microbes"/> Bacteria are a type of biological cell.Their domain largely constittutes of prokaryotic organisms.They are typically a few micrometres in length and their shapes range from spheres, to rods and spirals.
              It's speculated that  bacteria are among the first life forms to appear on Earth.

        <h2>Bacterial Diversity</h2>
          <p class="aside">Bacteria are the most numerous and diverse ethnic group in the microbial world. Bacteriaare called
            prokaryotes because they lack nuclei and organelles.

          <h2>Medically</h2>
          <p>In order to deal with these harmful bacteria, humans have developed antibiotics, a magic substance
            produced by actinomycetes, <strong class="halite">which can help us fight bacteria and reduce the
            mortality of diseases.</strong>The life expectancy of mankind is far beyond what can be imagined
            in the nineteenth century, all thanks to antibiotics.

              <p>In addition to medical uses, microorganisms play the role of decomposers in the environment.</p>

              <ul>
                
                <li>They can circulate the fixed nutrients in the biosphere, so that the nutrients can
                      flow in different organisms;</li>
                  <li>They also help us decompose the toxic substances in the environment, so that the polluted
                      environment can be used again by us;</li>
                  
                  <li>They also produce some greenhouse gas, causing environmental damage.</li>
              </ul>

          <p>Bacteria are also used to produce some dairy products, such as cheese and yogurt.</p>

          <p>There are many different types of bacteria. One way of classifying them is by shape. There are three basic shapes.</p>
