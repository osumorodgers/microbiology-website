            <h3>Introduction To Algae</h3>
            <p>Algae are a type of eukaryote in the protist world. They are mainly aquatic and have fixed cell walls,
                and because they have chlorophyll, they are also considered plant-like organisms.</p>

                <h3>In the food chain</h3> 
    
            <p>They are the first-level producers. Without them, we will face severe food shortages.<br>
             They are also responsible for the fishy smell or eutrophication<br>
             Some algae like dinoflagellate are highly toxic and have serious consequences for the body.</p>
